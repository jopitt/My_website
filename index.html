            <p>Jessica Irvine is a senior economics writer with The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.</p>
            <p>Jess's article is a wrap up of six things Jess learned about money in 2021. From scoring a deal on her mortgage, salary sacrificing into super for the first time, to investing, it’s been an action-packed year. Jess also dropped some hints about what she plans to write about in 2022!.</p>
            <p>Plenty of journalists cover superannuation and budgeting, but it isn't every day that readers get such a personal look into a writer's spending habits. The self-professed "numbers nerd" devotes her spare time to chronicling every cent she spends in her personal life, from movie rentals and bus fairs, to childcare and grocery bills. </p>
            <p>Jess writes a personal finance column, published on Sundays, where she aims to empower her readers to manage their personal finances. "I often share details from my own personal financial life, as I believe this makes money seem more relatable. I also write ad hoc longer interviews, profiles, features and explainers on whatever else comes up", Jess said.</p>

            <h4>Violeta │ Isabel Allende</h4>
            <p>One extraordinary woman. One hundred years of history. One unforgettable story.
            <p>Violeta comes into the world on a stormy day in 1920, the first daughter in a family of five boisterous sons. From the start, her life is marked by extraordinary events, for the ripples of the Great War are still being felt, even as the Spanish flu arrives on the shores of her South American homeland almost at the moment of her birth. Through her father's prescience, the family will come through that crisis unscathed, only to face a new one as the Great Depression transforms the genteel city life she has known. Her family loses all and is forced to retreat to a wild and beautiful but remote part of the country. There, she will come of age, and her first suitor will come calling.</p>
            <p>In a letter to someone she loves above all others, Violeta recounts devastating heartbreak and passionate affairs, times of both poverty and wealth, terrible loss and immense joy, and a life shaped by some of the most important events of history: The fight for women's rights, the rise and fall of tyrants and, ultimately, not one but two pandemics.</p>
            <p>Through the eyes of a woman whose unforgettable passion, determination, and sense of humour will carry her through a lifetime of upheaval, Isabel Allende once more brings us an epic that is both fiercely inspiring and deeply emotional.</p>

            <h4>Half Life │ Jillian Cantor</h4>
            <p>A brilliant sliding-doors reimagining of the passionate life of the first woman to win a Nobel Prize - and the life Marie Curie might have led if she had chosen love over science.</p>
            <p>
            Poland, 1891. Marie Curie (then Marya Sklodowska) was engaged to a budding mathematician, Kazimierz Zorawski. But when his mother insisted Marya was not good enough, he broke off the engagement. A heartbroken Marya left Poland for Paris to study chemistry and physics at the Sorbonne. Marie would go on to change the course of science forever and become the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.</p> <p>But what if Marie had made a different choice?</p>
            <p>What if she had stayed in Poland, married Kazimierz, and never attended the Sorbonne or discovered radium? What if Marie had chosen her first love and a life of domesticity, still ravenous for knowledge in Russian Poland where education for women was restricted, instead of studying science in Paris and meeting Pierre Curie?</p>

            <p>Looking for reinvention, want to write about it for Womankind magazine? Then why not take up Womankind's 'Reinvention' challenge this week, and, if chosen, get your ideas included in the upcoming issue of Womankind magazine.</p>
            <p>Starting this Friday until Sunday this week, the Womankind 'Reinvention' challenge involves finding one thing in your life that you've wanted to change for a while, and doing something about it, however small. Perhaps you will select one item that has been at the top of your New Year's Resolution list for a long time, and doing it for just two minutes a day. That's it. Perhaps you've always wanted to change careers, or pick up a new hobby - well, take two minutes a day to research or plan how this could come about.</p>
            <p>In this challenge we ask you to keep a diary of your ‘Reinvention’ for three days, describing what your reinvention entailed, the steps you took to complete the challenge, as well how making these steps towards your goal made you feel <a href="https://womankindmag.com/articles/womankinds-reinvention-challenge/" target="_blank">[...]</a></p>

            <h4>The heat is on</h4>
            <p>A key requirement for self-sustaining energy generation using nuclear fusion is for the plasma in which the fusion occurs to be heated by the fusion reactions themselves.</p>
            <p>In this week’s issue, Alex Zylstra and his colleagues demonstrate a ‘burning plasma’ regime in which fusion reactions are the primary source of heat that sustains the plasma. Working at the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, the researchers used 192 lasers to create a plasma of deuterium and tritium.</p>
            <p>By optimizing the experimental set-up the team was able to create conditions under which the plasma became self-heating — a key step towards making nuclear fusion a viable power source.</p>
            <p>The cover shows one of the ‘targets’ used by the team to create a burning plasma. The deuterium–tritium fuel capsule is visible in circular window at the centre. When irradiated by the laser beams, the target capsule melts and implodes, starting the fusion reaction.</p>

            <h4>Jackie</h4>
            <p>Jackie was surrendered to the sanctuary in September 2019 from a dairy farm that had ceased operation. Jackie came into the sanctuary's care pregnant with what was to be her last child (she previously had 6 babies in 7 years and each of her babies were removed from her so her milk could be taken and sold for human consumption). She gave birth to a beautiful girl her carers named 'Hope'. Jackie hid Hope from the carers for 5 days after birthing her and protected her from humans at all costs. Jackie has also adopted another calf as her own, Beau. She has raised both Hope and Beau beautifully, and loves her children as every mother does. Jackie not only is Hope and Beau's mother, but she is the matriarch of the herd and often can be seen mothering all the other cows.</p>

            <p>In 2010 Bubba came to live at Cranky’s Farm and was one of the first 3 to arrive, alongside Cranky and Pushy. Bubba was the biggest of the 3 and was really sweet and slow.</p>
            <p>Bubba was only 4 months old and weighed about 80 kilos when he arrived.  Now he's almost 9 years old and weighs about 900 kilos.  Some of the carers at Cranky’s can’t even see over Bubba when they stand beside him.</p>
            <p>Although Bubba is massive he is still super sweet and very gentle and now the leader of his big family. Bubba tries to keep everyone safe and sometimes has to break up fights which he does wonderfully.</p>
            <p>Bubba is a big, beautiful, gentle giant and he has horns in the shape of a love heart!</p>
